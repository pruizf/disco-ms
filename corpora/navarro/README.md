## About the *Corpus of Spanish Golden Age Sonnets*

- The files in the directories below come from or are based on the [*Corpus of Spanish Golden Age Sonnets*](https://github.com/bncolorado/CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro) by Borja Navarro and collaborators. The repository was at commit [ed72610](https://github.com/bncolorado/CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro/tree/ed72610018879e9a23ba724c2dc9adb50263d1ec) when we cloned it.
- The original material is in directory [CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro](./CorpusSonetosSigloDeOro). The remaining folders contain versions we created based on that (e.g. adding enjambment annotations).
